    <h3>TERMS OF SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE</h3>
    <h4>Effective: March 13, 2019</h4>
    <p>
      These Terms of Subscription Service (“Agreement”) are entered into by and between the entity
or person placing an order or accessing the Solutions (as defined below) (“Client”) and the
HealthJam entity specified on the Quote or other order form. If the HealthJam entity is not
HealthJam Inc., then Supplemental Terms apply as follows:
 If the HealthJam entity entering into this Agreement is WT EMEA Acquisition Limited,
then the terms in Exhibit E-1(Supplemental Terms) apply and will prevail in event of a
conflict with the main body of this Agreement.
 If the HealthJam entity entering into this Agreement is HealthJam Nordic AB, then the
terms in Exhibit E-2 (Supplemental Terms) apply and will prevail in event of a conflict
with the main body of this Agreement
HealthJam Inc., WT EMEA Acquisition Limited and HealthJam Nordic AB are each referred to
herein as “HealthJam”.
The “Effective Date” of this Agreement is the date that is the earlier of (a) the effective date of
the first Quote referencing this Agreement and (b) Client’s initial access to the Solutions through
any HealthJam online registration, provisioning, or order process.
If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you
represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this Agreement in which case the term
“Client” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree to the
terms of this Agreement, do not accept this Agreement or use the Solutions. If you receive free
access or a trial or evaluation subscription to the Solutions, you are deemed a “Client”
under this Agreement and are subject to its terms, including the restrictions and
limitations in Section 7.4 (Trial Subscriptions) below. You may not use or access the
Solutions if you are a direct competitor of HealthJam or if you are accessing or using the
Solutions for the benefit of a direct competitor of HealthJam.
This Agreement permits Client to purchase a subscription to Solutions and related Professional
Services from HealthJam pursuant to Quotes and sets forth the terms and conditions under
which those Solutions and Professional Services will be delivered. This Agreement shall govern
Client’s initial purchase as well as any future purchases made by Client that reference this
Agreement. This Agreement includes any and all Exhibits, referenced policies and attachments,
and any and all Quotes and SOWs.
From time to time, HealthJam may modify this Agreement with ten (10) days’ notice to Client.
Unless otherwise specified by HealthJam, changes become effective for existing Clients upon
posting of the modified Agreement. If Client does not agree to such changes, Client must notify
HealthJam of such disagreement within the ten (10) day notice period, and HealthJam (at its
option and as Client’s exclusive remedy) may either: (i) permit Client to continue under the prior
version of this Agreement until the next renewal of the current Order Term, after which the
modified Agreement will apply (for example, if Client is on an annual Order Term, then the
modified Agreement will apply starting from the beginning of Client’s next annual Order Term
after it is posted) or (ii) terminate this Agreement and provide to Client a refund of any Solution
fees that Client already paid with respect to the terminated portion of the applicable Order Term.
HealthJam will use reasonable efforts to notify Client of the changes through Client’s Account,
email, or other means. Client may be required to click to accept the modified Agreement before
using the Solutions in a renewal Order Term, and in any event continued use of the Solutions

during the renewal Order Term will constitute Client’s acceptance of the version of the
Agreement in effect at the time the renewal Order Term begins.
Each party expressly agrees that this Agreement is legally binding upon it.

testing and targeting. The Solutions are provided on a subscription basis for specified Order
Terms. HealthJam may make available optional add-ons or code, which are also included in the
“Solutions” under this Agreement and may be subject to supplementary terms specified by
HealthJam.
2.2 Access and Use – Client may access and use the Solutions specified on the applicable
Quote during the applicable Order Terms solely for its own internal business purposes and in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Documentation, and any scope

Tagging Methods (for use with the Solutions and related backup purposes) and to deploy
Tagging Methods on Client Applications. For Tagging Methods provided in source code format,
Client may make modifications as permitted in the Documentation, except that Client may not
take any action that would subject the Tagging Methods to any third party terms, including any
open source license terms. Use of the Solutions is charged based on, or limited to, the

Units as set forth in the applicable Quote and Exhibit A (Purchased Unit Definitions).
2.3 Permitted Users – Client may allow its Permitted Users to access and use the Solutions,
provided (i) Client remains responsible for compliance by each Permitted User with all of the

designated in the applicable Quote, and (ii) any use of the Solutions by a Permitted User is for
the sole benefit of Client or its Affiliates. Only Client and its Permitted Users may access and use
the Solutions, and use of the Solutions by Client and its Permitted Users in the aggregate must

number of Purchased Units. Client acknowledges that personal data of Permitted Users is used
by HealthJam in accordance with HealthJam’ Privacy Statement located
at https://www.HealthJam.com/legal/privacy-statement/ and is processed and stored in the
United States (“U.S.”).
2.4 Accounts – Each Permitted User shall receive a unique user ID, which may not be shared.
Client shall require that all Permitted Users keep their authentication factors (such as user ID and

notify HealthJam of any unauthorized access to or use of its Account.

bombs, Trojan horses, or other harmful or malicious code, files, scripts, agents, or programs).
3. SOLUTIONS DATA
3.1 Collection of Client Data – The Tagging Methods are provided with a default set of data
points for collection of Client Data. In addition, Client may configure the Tagging Methods to
collect other specific data points in accordance with this Agreement. Client Data may be
aggregated or individualized as configured by Client and as further described in the
Documentation. Further, the default set of data points varies based on the particular Solution.
3.2 Rights in Solutions Data; Right to Use Solutions Data – As between the parties, Client
shall retain all right, title, and interest (including any and all intellectual property rights) in the
Client Data, and HealthJam claims no right, title or interest in Client’s Third Party Data. Subject to
the terms of this Agreement, Client hereby grants to HealthJam a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free right to use, copy, store, transmit, modify, create derivative works of, and perform
and display in Client’s Account the Solutions Data solely to the extent necessary to provide the
Solutions to Client. Further, HealthJam may periodically access Client’s Account and Solutions
Data to improve, support, and operate the Solutions (e.g., for quality assurance, benchmarking,
technical support, or billing purposes).
3.3 Data Retention Policy – HealthJam retains Client Data in accordance with the Data
Retention Policy attached as Exhibit B. HealthJam expressly disclaims all other obligations with
respect to data storage or delivery, including storage or delivery of any raw data included in
Client Data.
3.4 Client Obligations

(a) Generally. Client is solely responsible for the accuracy, content, and legality of all Solutions
Data and for its Client Applications. Client shall ensure that Client’s use of the Solutions and all
Solutions Data is at all times compliant with Client’s and any applicable Third Party Platform’s
privacy policies and all Laws, including (if applicable) the California Online Privacy Protection Act
or similar laws governing data tracking across sites. Subject to HealthJam’ obligations in Section
3.5(b) regarding Third Party Terms, Client shall obtain all third party licenses, rights, clearances,
consents and approvals that may be required for Client (and HealthJam on behalf of Client) to
collect and use Solutions Data and represents and warrants that such collection and use will not
violate any Laws or any intellectual property, publicity, privacy, or other rights of any third party.
(b) Prohibited Data. The Solutions are not designed for processing of Prohibited Data and the
default configurations of the Tagging Methods (as provided by HealthJam) do not collect
Prohibited Data. Notwithstanding any other provision included herein, Client will not configure the
Tagging Methods or use the Solutions to collect, upload, retrieve, transmit, store, analyze,
create, or deliver Prohibited Data and will not otherwise provide Prohibited Data to HealthJam.
Client acknowledges that HealthJam is not a Business Associate or subcontractor (as those
terms are defined in HIPAA). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, HealthJam shall
have no liability under this Agreement for Prohibited Data.
(c) Configuration of Regional Option. HealthJam offers three options with respect to the
geographical locations of the data centers that will collect Client Data: Global, U.S.-EU only, and
U.S. only. Client will select a regional option by implementing the Tagging Methods for the
selected option on its Client Applications. Client acknowledges that the selection and use of a
regional option is controlled by the implementation of the applicable Tagging Methods, and Client
will be solely responsible for such implementation. If Client chooses to change the selected
regional option, Client will be responsible for implementing Tagging Methods specific to the new
regional option on its Client Applications. When selecting a restricted geographical option (i.e.,
U.S.-EU only or U.S. only), Client acknowledges that it will forego the data collection and content
delivery performance advantages offered by HealthJam’ data centers located in countries outside
the selected geographical option. HealthJam shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
that Client Data will not transit through or be stored in locations not allowed based on the
selected regional option.
3.5 Third Party Platforms – If Client uses the Solutions (i) to retrieve Third Party Data from a
Third Party Platform (such as Facebook, Twitter, or iTunes) or (ii) to share Solutions Data with a
Third Party Platform (such as ExactTarget, Tableau, or Teradata), this Section 3.5 applies.
(a) Use of Third Party Platforms. Client is solely responsible for determining whether to use the
Solutions with Third Party Platforms, including whether to retrieve Third Party Data from Third
Party Platforms or whether to share Solutions Data with Third Party Platforms, whether directly or
via the Solutions. HealthJam shall have no responsibility for any Third Party Platforms, including
for their availability, security, functionality, operation, or integrity, or for any use of Solutions Data
by Third Party Platforms. Client acknowledges that Third Party Platforms may impose quotas or
other usage restrictions. From time to time, HealthJam may change which Third Party Platforms
may be used with the Solutions or discontinue integration with any Third Party Platforms.
(b) Authorization. HealthJam may make available functionality that enables Client to access its
own accounts on Third Party Platforms through the Solutions. If Client enables use of Third Party
Platforms, Client authorizes HealthJam to access such Third Party Platforms, retrieve and use
Third Party Data, or share Solutions Data, as permitted in this Agreement. Each of Client and
HealthJam is responsible for its own compliance with the applicable terms between such party
and a Third Party Platform (e.g., account terms for Client and API integration terms for
HealthJam) (“Third Party Terms”).
4. INTENTIONALLY OMITTED

5. SOLUTIONS SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION &amp; PRIVACY
5.1 Solutions Security – HealthJam agrees to use commercially reasonable technical and
organizational measures designed to prevent unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure
of the Client Data, as further described in Exhibit C (Solutions Security). Except to the extent
caused by HealthJam’ breach of this Exhibit C, HealthJam shall have no responsibility for errors
in transmission, unauthorized third-party access, or other causes beyond HealthJam’ control.
Further, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, HealthJam is not responsible in any way
for Solutions Data after such Solutions Data is transmitted, copied, extracted, or removed from
HealthJam’ servers by Client or a Third Party Platform.
5.2 Protection of Personal Data – Subject to Section 3.4(b) (Prohibited Data), as part of its
authorized use of the Solutions, Client may configure the Tagging Methods to collect certain
personal data from users of Client Applications. Without limiting its obligations in Section 5.1
(Solutions Security), HealthJam agrees to process personal data only for the purpose of
performing this Agreement and in accordance with Client’s instructions (as set forth in this
Agreement, through the use of the selected regional option, and any applicable Order Form or
SOW), and applicable Laws.
Further, for personal data that is subject to the EU Data Protection Directive:
(a) Privacy Shield Self-Certification. HealthJam self-certifies that: (i) it complies with the U.S.-EU
Privacy Shield principles and meets the requirements of the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield framework;
and (ii) all Client Data transferred from the EU to the U.S. will be processed in accordance with
those requirements. HealthJam’ Privacy Statement provides further information.
(b) U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Self-Certification. HealthJam self-certifies that: (i) it complies with the
U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor principles and meets the requirements of the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor
framework; and (ii) all Client Data transferred from Switzerland to the U.S. will be processed in
accordance with those requirements. HealthJam’ Privacy Statement provides further information.
The terms “controller”, “process”, “processor”, and “personal data” have the meanings given to
them in the EU Data Protection Directive. The parties acknowledge that, pursuant to the EU Data
Protection Directive and applicable data protection Laws, Client is the controller and HealthJam
Inc. is the processor and data importer.
HealthJam will forward to Client all data subject access requests and any other requests from
data subjects exercising their rights pursuant to Article 12 of the EU Data Protection Directive.
6. OWNERSHIP – This is a subscription agreement for access to and use of the Solutions. Client
acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to the Solutions and that irrespective of any
use of the words “purchase”, “sale”, or like terms hereunder, no ownership rights are being
conveyed to Client under this Agreement. Client agrees that HealthJam or its licensors retain all
right, title and interest (including all patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other
intellectual property rights) in and to the Solutions (including Tagging Methods, APIs, SDKs and
Documentation), Deliverables (excluding Client Materials), all report templates and pre-existing
content and materials of HealthJam, all related and underlying technology, documentation, work
product, tools, designs, methodologies, processes, techniques, ideas, and know-how, and all
derivative works, modifications, or improvements of any of the foregoing, as well as all
comments, questions, suggestions, or other feedback relating to the Solutions or Professional
Services that Client submits to HealthJam (collectively, “HealthJam Technology”). Except for
the limited right to access and use the Solutions as expressly set forth in this Agreement, no
rights in any HealthJam Technology are granted to Client. Further, Client acknowledges that the
Solutions are offered as an on-line, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution, and that Client has

no right to obtain a copy of any underlying code or technology in any Solution, other than
Tagging Methods.
7. ORDER TERM, FEES &amp; PAYMENT
7.1 Order Term and Renewals – Unless otherwise specified on the applicable Quote, each
Order Term shall automatically renew for additional twelve (12) month periods unless either party
gives the other written notice of termination at least ninety (90) days prior to expiration of the
then-current Order Term.
7.2 Fees and Payment – All fees are as set forth in the applicable Quote or SOW and shall be
paid by Client in accordance with the invoice schedule and in the currency set forth in the
applicable Quote or SOW (and if none, within thirty (30) days of the date of applicable invoice
and in U.S. currency). Except as expressly set forth in Section 8.2 (Termination for Cause),
Section 9.1 (Limited Warranty), Section 11.4 (Limited Professional Services Warranty), and
Section 13.1 (Indemnification by HealthJam), all fees are non-refundable. The rates in the
applicable Quote or SOW are valid for the Order Term set forth in such Quote or SOW and
thereafter shall be subject to an increase of no more than five percent (5%) per year (subject to
Client retaining the same Solutions package, capacity and functionality levels). Client is required
to pay any sales, use, Goods and Services Tax (GST), value-added, withholding, or similar taxes
or levies, whether domestic or foreign (other than taxes based on the income of HealthJam), and
all such taxes and levies are excluded from any rates or prices provided by HealthJam. Any late
payments shall be subject to a service charge equal to 1.5% per month of the amount due or the
maximum amount allowed by Law, whichever is less.
7.3 Suspension of Solutions – If (a) HealthJam has sent Client a payment reminder for an
overdue payment, and Client fails to pay the amount due within seven (7) days after receiving
such payment reminder, or (b) Client has breached its obligations under Section 2.5 (General
Restrictions) or Section 3.4 (Client Obligations), then, in addition to any of its other rights or
remedies (including but not limited to any termination rights set forth herein), HealthJam reserves
the right to suspend Client’s access to the applicable Solution, content delivery and any related
support, or Professional Services, without liability to Client, until payment has been made or the
breach has been cured. Prior to suspending Client’s access for Client’s breach of Section 2.5
(General Restrictions) or Section 3.4 (Client Obligations), HealthJam will use reasonable efforts
to provide Client with notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure, unless HealthJam reasonably
determines that such breach may cause harm to other clients or threaten the security or integrity
of a Solution, in which case suspension may be immediate.
7.4 Trial Subscriptions – If Client receives free access or a trial or evaluation subscription to the
Solutions (a “Trial Subscription”), then Client may use the Solutions in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable Quote for the period designated in
such Quote or otherwise by HealthJam (and if not designated, then for thirty (30) days) (“Trial
Period”). Trial Subscriptions are permitted solely for Client’s use to determine whether to
purchase a full subscription to the Solutions. Client may not use a Trial Subscription for any other
purpose, including for competitive analysis. At the end of the Trial Period, the Trial Subscription
will expire and Client will have the option to purchase a full subscription to the Solutions. If Client
purchases a full subscription, all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement will apply to such
purchase and the use of the Solutions unless otherwise specified in the Quote for the Trial
Subscription. HealthJam has the right to terminate a Trial Subscription at any time for any
reason. The Solutions may have a mechanism that limits access to such Solutions during the
Trial Period and HealthJam may otherwise restrict certain product functionality during the Trial
Period (including limiting Purchased Units or other usage as may be specified by HealthJam).
Client shall not attempt to circumvent any such mechanism or restriction. Notwithstanding
Section 3.3 (Data Retention Policy) or Exhibit B (Data Retention Policy), HealthJam has no
obligation to retain Solutions Data collected or retrieved with a Trial Subscription during or after
the Trial Period. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS

AGREEMENT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, DURING THE TRIAL
PERIOD THE SOLUTIONS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND HEALTHJAM WILL HAVE NO
WARRANTY OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO TRIAL SUBSCRIPTIONS
UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN THE QUOTE.

and Erase any Solutions Data in its possession at any time, except for backup copies kept for
disaster recovery purposes or as required to comply with Laws. Neither party shall have any
liability resulting solely from a permitted termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms. Except where an exclusive remedy is specified, the exercise of either party of any remedy
under this Agreement, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other remedies it
may have under this Agreement, by law or otherwise.

Marketing Services. The scope of the Professional Services, and the fees for the Professional

Services (whether on a fixed-fee or hourly rate basis), shall be as set forth in an applicable Quote
or SOW.
11.2 Rights to Deliverables – Client may use any Deliverables solely in support of its authorized
use of the applicable Solution, subject to the same terms and conditions that apply to such
Solution and any additional terms in the applicable Quote or SOW. As an exception to the
preceding sentence, for any Design Deliverables, effective upon full and final payment of all fees
and expenses owing to HealthJam, HealthJam grants Client a non-exclusive, perpetual,
worldwide, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, publicly display and perform,
distribute, and create derivative works of the Design Deliverables for Client’s business purposes.
While Client may continue to use the Design Deliverables after termination or expiration of this
Agreement, such continued use is “AS IS”, with no warranty or other obligation from HealthJam.
11.3 Client Materials – Client shall provide HealthJam with access to Client Materials and
hereby grants HealthJam a limited right to use Client Materials solely for the purpose of
performing the Professional Services hereunder. Client represents and warrants that it has all
rights necessary in the Client Materials to provide them to HealthJam for such purpose.
11.4 Limited Professional Services Warranty – HealthJam warrants that the Professional
Services will be of a professional quality and conform to generally prevailing industry standards.
Client must give written notice of any material breach of the foregoing warranty within thirty (30)
days from the date the Professional Services are completed. In such event, at HealthJam’ sole
discretion, HealthJam shall either:
(a) use commercially reasonable efforts to re-perform the Professional Services in a manner that
conforms to the foregoing warranty; or
(b) if HealthJam fails to re-perform or decides not to re-perform the Professional Services, refund
to Client the portion of fees paid by Client to HealthJam for the nonconforming Professional
Services.
The foregoing procedures shall constitute HealthJam’ sole liability (and Client’s sole and
exclusive remedy) for any breach of the warranty in this Section 11.4.
12. LIMITATION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES
12.1 Consequential Damages Waiver – NEITHER PARTY (NOR ITS LICENSORS) SHALL BE
LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, ANY LOSS OF USE, OR
INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN
IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE.
12.2 Liability Cap – EXCEPT FOR EXCLUDED CLAIMS, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER
PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY’S AND ITS LICENSORS’ ENTIRE
LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID OR PAYABLE BY
CLIENT TO HEALTHJAM DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT.
12.3 Excluded Claims – “Excluded Claims” means (a) amounts payable to third parties by
Client pursuant to Section 13.2 (Indemnification by Client) or (b) any claim arising from Client’s
breach of Section 2.5 (General Restrictions) or Section 3 (Solutions Data).

12.4 Failure of Essential Purpose – The parties agree that the limitations specified in this
Section 12 will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found
to have failed of its essential purpose.
13. INDEMNIFICATION
13.1 By HealthJam – HealthJam shall defend Client from and against any claim by a third party
alleging that HealthJam’ proprietary technology used in the performance of the Solutions, when
used as authorized under this Agreement, actually infringes a U.S. or Great Britain (“GBR”)
patent, U.S. or GBR copyright, or U.S. or GBR trademark, and shall indemnify and hold harmless
Client from and against any damages and costs awarded against Client or agreed in settlement
by HealthJam (including reasonable legal fees) resulting from such claim.
If Client’s use of any Solution is (or in HealthJam’ opinion is likely to be) enjoined, if required by
settlement, or if HealthJam determines such actions are reasonably necessary to avoid material
liability, HealthJam may, in its sole discretion:
(a) substitute substantially functionally similar products or services;
(b) procure for Client the right to continue using the Solution; or
(c) if (a) and (b) are not commercially reasonable, terminate the Agreement and refund to Client
any Solution fees that Client already paid with respect to the terminated portion of the applicable
Order Terms.
The foregoing indemnification obligation of HealthJam shall not apply:
(1) if the Solution is modified by any party other than HealthJam, but solely to the extent the
alleged infringement is caused by such modification;
(2) if the Solution is combined with products or processes not provided by HealthJam, but solely
to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination;
(3) to any unauthorized use of the Solution;
(4) to any action arising as a result of Solutions Data or any third-party deliverables or
components contained within the Solution;
(5) to any release or version of the Tagging Methods other than the then-current release or
version; or
(6) if Client settles or makes any admissions with respect to a claim without HealthJam’ prior
written consent.
THIS SECTION 13.1 SETS FORTH HEALTHJAM’ AND ITS SUPPLIERS’ SOLE LIABILITY AND
CLIENT’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM THAT
HEALTHJAM’ PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY USED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THE
SOLUTIONS INFRINGES A U.S. OR GBR PATENT, U.S. OR GBR COPYRIGHT, OR U.S. OR
GBR TRADEMARK.
13.2 By Client – Client shall defend HealthJam from and against any claim by a third party
arising from or relating to:

(a) any Solutions Data or Client Application; or
(b) any breach or alleged breach by Client of Section 3.4 (Client Obligations); or
(c) any service or product offered by Client through the Client Applications,
and shall indemnify and hold harmless HealthJam from and against any damages awarded
against HealthJam or agreed in settlement by Client (including reasonable legal fees) resulting
from such claim.
13.3 Indemnification Process – The obligations of each indemnifying party are conditioned
upon receiving from the party seeking indemnification:
(a) prompt written notice of a claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for the indemnifying
party to respond without prejudice);
(b) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, and settlement (if
applicable) of the claim; and
(c) all reasonable necessary cooperation of the indemnified party.
The indemnified party may participate in the defense of any claim with counsel of its own
choosing at its expense. The indemnifying party may not settle a claim without the indemnified
party’s prior written consent unless such settlement unconditionally releases the indemnified
party from all liability and does not require the indemnified party to take or refrain from taking any
action (except with respect to use or non-use of the Solutions or allegedly infringing materials).
14. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION – Each party (as “Receiving Party”) agrees that all code,
inventions, know-how, business, technical, and financial information that it obtains from the
disclosing party (“Disclosing Party”) constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party
(“Confidential Information”), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure
or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be Confidential Information due to the
nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure. Without
limiting the foregoing, any HealthJam Technology, performance information relating to the
Solutions, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all Quotes and SOWs shall be
deemed Confidential Information of HealthJam without any marking or further designation.
Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will:
(a) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties; and
(b) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and
exercising its rights under this Agreement.
The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors,
and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for HealthJam, the
subcontractors referenced in Section 16.10), provided that: (i) such representatives are bound to
confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 14; and (ii)
the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by any such representative with the
terms of this Section 14. The Receiving Party’s nondisclosure obligation shall not apply to
information which the Receiving Party can document:
(1) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information;
(2) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party;

(3) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any
confidentiality obligation; or
(4) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such
information.
The Receiving Party may make disclosures to the extent required by law or court order, provided
the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party in advance and cooperates in any effort to
obtain confidential treatment. The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential
Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient
remedy, and therefore, that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing
Party shall be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies
it might have at law.
15. MARKETING – During the term of the Agreement, HealthJam may use Client’s name, logos,
and trademarks to identify Client as a customer on HealthJam’ website, social media, and other
marketing materials.
16. GENERAL TERMS

decrease HealthJam’ obligations as compared to those reflected in such terms as of the Effective
Date).
16.9 Force Majeure – Neither party shall be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform
any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due
to unforeseen events which occur after the signing of this Agreement and which are beyond the
reasonable control of such party, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural
disaster, failure or diminishment of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or
refusal of a license by a government agency.
16.10 Subcontractors – HealthJam may use the services of subcontractors and permit them to

Exhibit A
Purchased Unit Definitions
HealthJam Infinity Analytics and HealthJam Analytics (A9/A10):
“Server Call” is the unit of measurement for usage of the HealthJam Infinity Analytics Solution or
HealthJam Analytics (A9/A10) Solution, as applicable. A Server Call is incurred when a request
is sent to the data collection servers for the applicable Solution, when such request is sent by the
Tagging Methods. “Server Call Entitlement” means the number of Server Calls purchased in
the Quote during the Order Term. If, during the Order Term, Client’s actual usage exceeds the
Server Call Entitlement, Client shall either (a) purchase additional Server Calls at the rate set
forth in the Quote, or (b) pay Continuation Fees to HealthJam. “Continuation Fees” will be
determined by multiplying the number of Server Calls collected in increments of one thousand,
and any fractions thereof, in excess of the Server Call Entitlement by the Cumulative CPM.
“Cumulative CPM” for Server Calls means the cost per thousand Server Calls as set forth in the
Quote. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Order Term, the Server Call Entitlement
shall expire. All additional Server Calls purchased in the middle of any Order Term will be
coterminous with the then current Order Term.
HealthJam Infinity Data Connector:

“Volume” is the unit of measurement for usage of the HealthJam Infinity Data Connector.
“Volume Entitlement” means the total volume of extracted Client Data, as measured in
gigabytes, set forth in the applicable Quote. If the volume of extracted Client Data exceeds the
Volume Entitlement during the Order Term, Client shall pay Continuation Fees to HealthJam.
“Continuation Fees” will be determined by multiplying the number of gigabytes extracted in
excess of the Volume Entitlement by the cost per gigabyte. Upon the expiration or earlier
termination of the Order Term, the Volume Entitlement shall expire. Any additional Volume
Entitlement purchased in the middle of any Order Term will be coterminous with the then current
Order Term.
HealthJam Segments:
Client’s right to access and use the HealthJam Segments Solution is limited to (i) analyzing the
data collected from Client Applications, (ii) tracking and loading up to the number of Events set
forth in the Quote (“Event Entitlement”), and (iii) accessing, viewing and downloading Solutions
Data. “Event” is the unit of measurement for usage of the HealthJam Segments Solution. An
Event is incurred when a visitor activity or a transaction, as defined by Client, is tracked and
loaded in the HealthJam database.
HealthJam shall have no obligation to return, and Client shall have no right to receive, any
portion of the fees if Client’s actual usage of Events is below the Event Entitlement. If, during the
Order Term, Client’s actual usage of the HealthJam Segments Solution exceeds the Event
Entitlement, Client shall either (a) purchase additional Events at the rate set forth in the Quote, or
(b) pay Continuation Fees to HealthJam. “Continuation Fees” will be determined by multiplying
the number of Events collected in increments of one thousand and any fractions thereof, in
excess of the Event Entitlement by the Cumulative CPM for the Order Term. “Cumulative CPM”
for Events means the cost per thousand Events as set forth in the Quote. Upon the expiration or
earlier termination of the Order Term, the Event Entitlement shall expire. All additional Events
purchased in the middle of any Order Term will be coterminous with the then current Order Term.
HealthJam Streams:
Client’s right to access and use the HealthJam Streams Solution is limited to (i) collecting,
accessing and retrieving Streams Data, up to the number of Streams Events set forth in the
Quote (“Streams Event Entitlement”) and (ii) establishing the number of Concurrent
Connections specified in the Quote.
HealthJam shall have no obligation to return, and Client shall have no right to receive, any
portion of the fees if Client’s actual Streams Event usage is below the Streams Event
Entitlement. If, during the Order Term, Client’s actual usage of HealthJam Streams exceeds the
Streams Event Entitlement, Client shall either (i) purchase additional Streams Events, or (ii) pay
Continuation Fees to HealthJam. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Order Term,
the Streams Event Entitlement shall expire. All additional Streams Events purchased in the
middle of any Order Term will be coterminous with the then current Order Term. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary within the Agreement, HealthJam shall have no obligation to (i) keep and
store Streams Data or (ii) store or deliver any raw data included in Streams Data, even if Client
has purchased access to raw data for another Solution.
The following definitions are used with respect to HealthJam Streams: “Continuation Fees” will
be determined by multiplying the number of Streams Events collected in increments of one
thousand, and any fractions thereof, in excess of the Streams Event Entitlement by the
Cumulative CPM. “Cumulative CPM” for Streams Events means the cost per thousand Streams
Events, as set forth in the Quote. “Streams Data” means the data collected via HealthJam
Streams; “Concurrent Connection” is a usage limitation for HealthJam Streams, and means the
number of connections between Client’s computer network and the HealthJam Streams server
which may occur concurrently, where a connection means a socket connection between

HealthJam Streams and any Client Application; “Streams Event” is the unit of measurement for
usage of HealthJam Streams. A Streams Event is counted against Client’s Streams Event
Entitlement when any event configured by or on behalf of Client to be collected, is collected and
delivered to the HealthJam Streams infrastructure, and then such event is consumed by a Client
Application. A Streams Event is counted against Client’s Streams Event Entitlement when such
Streams Event is consumed by any Client Application for each unique data stream.
Add-Ons:
All Add-Ons purchased in the middle of any Order Term will be pro-rated for the remainder of the
then-current Order Term (except for Server Calls, Events, and Streams Events) and will be
coterminous with the then-current Order Term. “Add-On” means any Solution purchased as an
add-on in a mutually executed Quote, purchase order, or invoice.

Exhibit C
Solutions Security

1. Definitions
Capitalized terms not included in this Exhibit C (Solutions Security) are defined in the
Agreement.
(a) “Information Technology Resources” – means all HealthJam facilities, equipment, and
systems used for delivering the Solutions.
(b) “Personnel” – means employees, temporary employees, subcontractors, and consultants of
HealthJam, in each case with access to Client Data and/or Information Technology Resources.
2. Information Security Management

HealthJam information security management system is based on ISO 27002. HealthJam
maintains a general Information Security Policy, updated annually, that explicitly addresses the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Client Data and Information Technology Resources,
and details employee’s responsibilities and managements’ role.
Comprehensive technical policies govern various aspects of HealthJam SaaS Operations and
general corporate IT, which policies define security measures appropriate to the sensitivity of the
data processed. These include specialized policies and procedures governing practices such as
incident response process, change management, and backups.
Policies are approved by senior management, communicated to all Personnel to whom the
policies apply, and clearly state the consequences of non-compliance. All employees must
review and sign HealthJam’ Information Security Policy during onboarding.
HealthJam has adopted a decentralized approach to Information Security. HealthJam VP
Technology &amp; Security coordinates all security and privacy activities within HealthJam.
Responsibilities of this position include:
 Driving security initiatives
 Policy creation and review
 Security planning and program management
 Reviewing effectiveness of the security program
 Coordinating HealthJam’ security incident response plan
 Performing annual security and privacy assessment and reviews
Implementation of security controls rests with the management of each relevant function.
HealthJam separates its SaaS Solutions production network and all associated functions from
general corporate IT. HealthJam VP Technology &amp; Security is responsible for the policies and
security implementation within the SaaS environment.
In support of teleworking, HealthJam deploys remote access with strong encryption and
authentication mechanisms across the Internet (using a commercial VPN product with multi-
factor authentication).
3. Human Resources
HealthJam has background checks performed on all employees at the time of hire (to the extent
permitted by Law), and requires that non-disclosure and/or confidentiality agreements are signed
by all Personnel. HealthJam’ policy prohibits employees from using Confidential Information
(including Client Data) other than for legitimate business purposes, such as providing technical
support, and this obligation continues after their employment ends.
Upon hire and annually thereafter, HealthJam provides employees with security and privacy
training, which addresses handling of sensitive or confidential information and Client Data,
employees’ responsibility for such data, risk of information sharing with unidentified callers,
phishing attacks, and use of security tools such as anti-malware solutions.
HealthJam maintains a formal termination or change of employment process that, promptly upon
termination or change of employment, requires return of any and all HealthJam and Client
assets, disables or adjusts access rights, and reminds ex-employees of their remaining
employment restrictions and contractual obligations.
4. Asset Management

HealthJam logically separates Client Data from each individual Client. All Client Data is classified
as highly confidential. HealthJam information classification affords Client Data the same or higher
level of security as it does HealthJam’ own highly confidential information.
HealthJam’ decommissioning procedures are designed to prevent access to Client Data by
unauthorized persons. HealthJam follows NIST Guidelines for Media Sanitization (Special Pub
800-88) to destroy data. All printed Confidential Information, including Client Data, is disposed of
in secured containers for shredding.
5. Access Control
HealthJam provides security-enabled identification, authentication, and authorization
mechanisms for Client access to its Solutions and employee access to the backend
infrastructure, and all passwords are securely hashed.
All Information Technology Resources used for the Solutions are managed under the policies of
the HealthJam SaaS Operations team, which is separate (both from a network domain
perspective and from a staffing perspective) from corporate network resources. All access is
limited to the least privilege needed and requires authentication. Access logs are reviewed at
least quarterly.
6. Cryptography
All authenticated accesses to HealthJam Solutions are over secure protocols such as HTTPS
(HTTP over TLS) or SFTP (FTP over SSH). TLS transfers are terminated at the load balancer
within the HealthJam production network. In addition, the Infinity Data Connector uses mutual-
authentication and PGP data encryption.
For the initial data collection, HealthJam JavaScript code automatically detects the protocol used
for the source page and uses the same (i.e., it defaults to HTTPS for secure pages and HTTP for
non-secure pages). Clients may override these defaults to force the use of HTTPS for all pages.
7. Physical and Environmental Controls
HealthJam SaaS Solutions infrastructure is physically separated from HealthJam corporate
facilities and managed by an independent SaaS Operations team. HealthJam SaaS Solutions
infrastructure uses a combination of colocation data center providers and Infrastructure-as-a-
Service (IaaS) providers. HealthJam maintains appropriate physical and environmental controls,
such as electronic card access and video monitoring at all HealthJam facilities.
8. Operations Security
HealthJam maintains documented procedures that include at a minimum:
 security control measures for all Information Technology Resources in the environment;
 hardening – disabling of all non-essential processes and ports, removing all default
users;
 patches deployed promptly on all applicable Information Technology Resources per
manufacturer recommendation, within 30 days for critical security patches;
 change management procedures; and
 incident detection and management.

HealthJam maintains Client Data within the Solutions production environment on fully redundant
or replicated storage systems, utilizes a multi-tiered backup approach, and transfers backup
media in locked containers for storage in a secured offsite location.
HealthJam maintains audit information and logs for all Information Technology Resources,
applications and network accesses, monitors these logs for abnormal patterns and unauthorized
access attempts, and maintains defined processes for security alerting, escalation and
remediation. Logs are centralized in a limited-access system that prevents deletion and changes.
HealthJam deploys anti-malware software with automatic scanning and updates on all
workstations; installs anti-malware software on all Windows external-facing web servers with
weekly scans; and scans all deployed code for malware.
Internal audits of the environment are performed at least quarterly and include, at a minimum,
intrusion detection and firewall configuration, access rights, and audit logs.
9. Communications Security
HealthJam follows guidance from the ISO/IEC 27002:2013 standard. Additionally, HealthJam
employs industry standard practices and relies on over 15 years of experience in operating highly
secure Solutions for security controls such as firewalls, intrusion detection, change management
and security policies.
HealthJam employs network security control measures over all Information Technology
Resources used to create, transmit, or process Client Data, including the following controls:
 Technology controls include, at a minimum, firewalls, security monitoring and alerting
systems, intrusion detection systems (IDS); and
 The environment is monitored and managed 24×7.
10. System Acquisition, Development and Maintenance
The HealthJam Solutions production environment (including facilities, network and staff) is
logically and physically separated from the HealthJam corporate and development environment.
HealthJam follows secure development industry standard practices, including the use of OWASP
Secure Coding Guidelines, and performs code reviews and security testing for key functionality.
11. Third Party Relationships
HealthJam uses third party service providers in its provision of the Solutions. HealthJam requires
material service providers (such as data centers, cloud infrastructure and content delivery
networks) to provide annual SOC 2 reports or ISO certifications, which HealthJam reviews for
consistency with industry standards and HealthJam’ security practices.
12. Security Incident Management
HealthJam maintains a documented security incident response process for reporting, responding
to, and managing any unauthorized access to, disclosure of, misuse of, and/or loss of Client
Data, and uses commercially reasonable efforts to notify Client within 48 hours of any breach
affecting their Client Data. Client agrees that HealthJam is not required to report unsuccessful
security events, such as pings on HealthJam’ firewall, port scans, and failed log-on attempts.
13. Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery

HealthJam maintains and tests a business continuity plan (BCP) and disaster recovery (DR) plan
that prioritizes critical functions (such as data collection) supporting the delivery of its Solutions to
its clients. Under such plans, the disruption resulting from a complete site outage at a data
collection center would be limited to single geographic region and would only last for a few
minutes while traffic gets automatically rerouted. HealthJam retains DR archives of Client Data
for up to two years after the backup. The HealthJam SaaS Operations team performs a
comprehensive annual risk assessment.
14. Compliance
HealthJam engages an independent third party security firm annually to conduct a vulnerability
scan of all external-facing (public) infrastructure devices and application penetration test of its
Solutions.
HealthJam does not allow clients to perform their own audits, but will reasonably collaborate with
Client for applicable audits required by regulators of Client. Any such audits are subject to
reasonable confidentiality and security procedures and the results of such audits constitute
Confidential Information of HealthJam.
